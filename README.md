# Sheetmaker

## Overview

*Sheetmaker* is a highly costumizable character sheet maker for table-top role-playing games. I created this app with 5e D&D in mind, but I designed the editor so that it can be used with any system just as easily. Essentially, you can **make custom character sheets tailored to your exact needs**. For example, if your group focuses on role-play much more than combat, then you can organize a sheet so that role-playing elements are at the top. Or, if you added your own combat system, you can add a detailed section all about it.

## Features

*Sheetmaker* allows you to create as many character sheets as you wish! (More accurately, as many as your browser will let you make.) They are viewed and created using The Editor

### The Editor

This is where the magic happens. There are two "modes": *Play* mode and *Edit* mode. *Play* mode is the default, and it has all the prettified sheet items. This is where you will spend most of your time after making a sheet. *Edit* mode allows you to add, edit, or delete items. Something to know about The Editor is that the sheet is divided into sections.

A sheet has three main sections...
- **Top Information Section**: Where things like your character name, level, and race go.
- **Stats Section**: Where important numbers go, such as your character's strength or intelligence.
- **Fields Section**: Where everything else goes! This takes up the majority of the editor.

### Current Presets

When making a new sheet, you can choose from a list of preset, partially-made sheets...

- **Blank**: Completely bare canvas, ready for anything you can make! This is the sheet you start with.
- **Basic 5e D&D**: Features a filled out **Top Information** section and **Stats** section.
- **Full 5e D&D**: Has all starting fields necessary for basic character creation. 

## Current Version

**Version 0.1.1**:

This is the first public release! üçæ

The features are pretty bare-bones for now, but don't worry! There are more on the way. Currently, there is...

- The Editor (described above).
- Self-formatting, both desktop and mobile friendly.
- Creating new sheets and deleting sheets.
- Saving sheets to your browser's local storage.
- Making and restoring backups of sheets.

Right now, it *works*, but it is missing some quality-of-life features. Thankfully, I plan to develop these in the near future.

## Future Development

Here is a list of features I hope to implement:

- Ability to move sheet items
- Ability to delete specific sheet elements, instead of just the last one
- Sharing sheets between friends through the editor
- Mobile-friendly system of making/restoring backups
- Better auto-formatting (specifically, a system that fills in empty space if there is any)
- More item elements (taking suggestions!)
- More sheet presets (also taking suggestions!)
- General UI Improvements as needed
